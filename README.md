The scrips used to create study variables were implemented and executed with Python 3.9 or Matlab R2022b.

1. SO_spindles_karaoke2024.py: Script for finding slow oscillations during which sleep spindle power peak exists.
2. SOspindle_couplingphase_karaoke2024.m: Extract slow oscillation phase at slow oscillation-coupled sleep spindle peaks.
3. angles_karaoke2024.py: Script for creating resultant vector length and 'optimally coupled' spindle variables.
4. EDA_mean_karaoke.m: Obtain mean values (based on markers) of skin conductance level.
5. EEG_preprocess_karaoke2024.m: Preprocess edf files and save as .set.
6. Powerspectraldensity_karaoke_2024.m: Calculate PSD from .set data.
7. Collect_PSD.m: Obtain mean PSD values.
